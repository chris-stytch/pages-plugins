# Pages Plugins

## Features

- ü•û **Completely composable**

  You can include multiple plugins, plugins can rely on other plugins, and they all share the same loading interface.

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Author a plugin as a folder of Functions**

  The straight-forward syntax and intuitive file-based routing we've developed for Functions can be used to write plugins.

- üì• **Simple loading mechanism for including plugins in projects**

  Mount the plugin wherever you want and optionally pass it data.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Plugins can bring static assets**

  We hide static assets behind an inaccessible URL (`/cdn-cgi/`) so they'll only be available in user-land where the plugin exposes them. And everything gracefully-ish falls back to the origin if deploying a regular Worker instead of a Pages project.

## Usage

### Including a plugin

Check out [the example application](./packages/example/README.md) which includes all the plugins we have so far.

If you want to run it with wrangler2, run this:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:GregBrimble/pages-plugins.git;
cd pages-plugins;
npm install;
npm start;
```

### Authoring a plugin

Check out these examples:

- [Cloudflare Access](./packages/cloudflare-access)
- [Sentry](./packages/sentry)
- [hCaptcha](./packages/hcaptcha)
- [Headers](./packages/headers)
- [GraphQL](./packages/graphql)
- [Google Chat](./packages/google-chat)

## Changes

### Added `functionPath`

This is the bit of the path that we matched on when deciding which Function to execute. (e.g. `_middleware.ts` on root would be `/`, a `date.ts` would be `/date`, and an `[path].ts` would be `/foo`).

The plugin needs to know where it's mounted in order to figure out its relative routing.

```ts
type EventContext<Env, P extends string, Data> = {
  request: Request;
  functionPath: string;
  waitUntil: (promise: Promise<unknown>) => void;
  next: (input?: Request | string, init?: RequestInit) => Promise<Response>;
  env: Env & { ASSETS: { fetch: typeof fetch } };
  params: Params<P>;
  data: Data;
};
```

## To Do

- More Plugins
- Static assets
- A testing story
- Publish Workers Types
